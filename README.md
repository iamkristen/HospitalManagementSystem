# University Assignment Software: Hospital Management System

## Overview
This software project was developed as an assignment for a university course, focusing on building a Hospital Management System. It provides functionality that allows users to interact with it either through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). The system utilizes file storage to store and load data, as per the assignment requirements.

## Features
- **CLI Interface**: Users can interact with the software through a command-line interface by running the `mainmenu` file.
- **GUI Interface**: For those preferring a graphical interface, the software offers a GUI option accessible by running the `mainapp` file. Note that to run the GUI, JavaFX must be installed on your system.
- **File Storage**: The system utilizes files to store and load data, facilitating the management of hospital-related information.
- **Functionality**: The software offers various features typical of a Hospital Management System, such as managing patient records, scheduling appointments, diagnosis, generating reports, etc.

## Usage
### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
To use the CLI interface:

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
To use the GUI interface, ensure JavaFX is installed on your system, then run:

## Requirements
- Java: To run the CLI, you only need Java installed on your system.
- JavaFX: To run the GUI, you'll need to have JavaFX installed.
